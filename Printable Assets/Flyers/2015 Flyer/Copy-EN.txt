What is a Hackerspace?

A Hackerspace is a place to
     · Collaborate on interesting projects
     · Study or practice on your own
     · Learn from knowledgeable people
     · Make friends 

Tokyo Hackerspace is both a location and an organisation.  The organisation consists of people enthused about acquiring and applying a wide variety of skills to learn, teach others, and help society.  The location is a garage space, giving us the ability to do industrial things like drilling, cutting and welding. We have a large selection of tools (both hand and power) and test/measurement equipment, plus storage space for members’ equipment and supplies. 
We have many fascinating classes and workshops, where you can:

	　· learn about electronics
	　· gain programming skills
	　· learn about Linux and BSD
	　· design circuit boards
	　· use a laser cutter
	　· learn welding and metalwork
	　· build robots and quadcopters
	　· learn to use power tools safely

Benefits of becoming a member include the ability to use the space 24/7 whenever you like; discounts on classes and workshops (all classes/workshops cost less for members than non-members); the ability to keep a “member’s box” at the space to hold your projects, parts, equipment, tools etc; the ability to use any of the Tokyo Hackerspace parts stock free of charge; and most importantly, ensuring the continued existence of Tokyo Hackerspace as a resource for everyone!

We look forward to meeting you!
